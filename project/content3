<h4>START-UP SERVICE</h4>
		<p>Start-up service begins before start-up, through a survey of the plant. This is important
		as to have as a comprehensive picture of the operations, personnel and local
		conditions as possible.</p>
		<p>Knowing the special conditions from the start avoids later problems.</p>
		<p><strong>2.1 Survey</strong><br>
	During this survey following actions should be made :<br>
	i. Inspection of cooling towers and associated hardware (such as feeding devices), heat
	exchangers and process equipment exposed to cooling tower.<br>
	li. Investigation of possible water sub-supplies and contaminations. Evaluation of the
	expected influence on the cooling water treatment program performances.<br>
	iii. On the spot questions and answer with management and plant operators to
	discover possible operational difficulties and company special effectiveness requirement
	for the different units of the system.<br>
	iv. Double-check review of all assembled information with proposal's data.</p>
	<p><strong>2.2 Precornissioning / Start-up</strong><br>
During start-up of the program, Water Services's Engineer will be present He will:<br>
i. Check the products received against the proposal or your records. Identify each
product and explain its specific use to person in charge.<br>
ii. Check to see that feeding arrangement is correct.
iii. Set up the testing equipment. Make sure that no equipment or reagents are
missing.<br>
iv. Recheck operating conditions to see if they have changed since the proposal was
written. If so, correct dosages accordingly.<br>
v. Start up the Amerprep program of precleaning and passivation program after it.
For the first two weeks after introduction of the chemicals, Water Servicess office's
specialists will remain in close contact with the plant, to strictly follow the treatment
and to answer any question that might come up.</p>
<p><strong>ROUTINE SERVICE</strong><br>
The routine service is splited in field and home service.</p>
<strong>3.1 Daily Service</strong>
<p>This is a new service approach that only WATER SERVICES offers for cooling water
treatment.</p>
<p>By this procedure the results of the daily tests carried out from your laboratory, plus
some additional data, easily collected from the control room's panel, are passed to
Water Services company, through tetecon, telex or telefax.</p>
<p>Those data are immediately analyzed by computer and an early warning alarm call is
actuated if a problem is indentified.</p>
<p>Else the data are filed as to be used for the summary report (see section H. 3. 3.)</p>
<strong>3.2 Field Service</strong><br>
<p>Routine field service will include every two weeks visits to the plant by an engineer of
Water Servicess Chemicals.</p>
<p>During those visits the responsible engineer will:<br>
i. Run corrosion rate measurements.<br>
ii. Review the summary reports and system tendencies fluctuations for possible
adjustements.<br>
iii. Check chemical inventories for recalculation of mecessary amounts.<br>
iv. Perform a complete water analysis on samples taken from the system to Water
Servicess Laboratory and mail a service report.<br>
v. Perform the same for biological analysis (total count).<br>
vi. Reply to answers that could be arise on treatment and train the personnel In
running the system correctly, via the continuous information system.<br>
vii. Inform plant's managements and personnel for possible thechnical improvements
and recent developments and applications.</p>
<strong>3.3 Summary report</strong>
<p>All data of daily and field service should be summarized in a summary report.<br>
Tendencies and parameters fluctuations will be plotted and outliners will be identified.<br>
Data after cross-check to water and biological analysis data collected from Water
Servicess laboratory (see section H.3.2.iv and H.3.3v) be evaluated and the resulting
comments and suggestions be included to the summary report.<br>
This report will be issued every two weeks and mailed to the customer. So the
responsible personnel has the opportunity to examine it (and discuss it in detail
during field service visit (see section H.3.2.2.).<br>
<strong>SPECIAL SERVICE</strong>
Special services outside the scope of the routine are also available for resolution of
unusual problems, such as :
<ul>
	<li>Turn arounds for the identification of special contamination effects and source
recovery.</li>
	<li>Close contact and consultancy during an oil contamination or process parameters of
tendencies excursions.</li>
	<li>Deposits of fouling samples analysis.</li>
</ul></p>
<p><strong>THE CUSTOMER'S RESPONSIBILITIES</strong><br>
i. Prepare chemical solutions as directed.<br>
ii. Run specified control tests.<br>
lii. Adjust dosages and blowdown or bleedoff to maintain control tolerances.<br>
iv. Keep complete records in duplicate or triplicate as needed. All necessary entries are
to be made on Water Control Data Sheets.<br>
v. Keep stock of products, reagents, etc. as needed. A minimum three month supply
should be kept on hand at all times.<br>
vi. Notify Water Servicess Representative of any equipment that is to be inspected, as
to be present, whenever necessary.<br>
vii. Notify Water Servicess Representative of any problems.</p>
