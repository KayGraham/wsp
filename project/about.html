			<h3>Our Industrial Activities</h3>
				<p>Our activities could be simply characterized as "industrial water treatment".</p>

				<p>But things are not so simple. Water systems in industries such as chemicals, fertilizers, petrochemicals,
					power stations, etc. constitute and considerable initial investment.</p>

				<p>Efficiency of these systems is essential for smooth plant operation. Due to rising costs of industrial
					water and energy, conservation has become a priority. It has also become an essential goal to extend
					equipment life and avoid unwarranted shut downs that result in loss of production.</p>

				<p>Water Services Ltd is committed to the supply of water treatment chemicals and services for the
					ongoing improvement and cost savings of an industry with these needs:</p>

							<li>Maintenance Chemicals</li>
							<li>Sea Water and Desalination Chemicals</li>
