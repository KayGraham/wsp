					<p>As Mr. Achileas Petrovits, Manager in Hellenic Petroleum Refinery said, "quite always, what 
					differentiates one supplier from another is the quality of the person servicing the customer".</p>

					<p>The one that is the most prompt, through and responsive usually satisfies the business.</p>

					<p>The first line of service Water Services provides is our local Water Services representatives. 
					They are skillful engineers, trained in our <a href="#">Water Treatment Academy</a>, from our water treatment experts.</p>

					<p>They partner with our customers to help meet your quality and productivity objectives.</p>

					<p>They accomplish this by not only treating and managing your cooling water treatment systems,
					but also by functioning as on-site engineering consultants who can manage everything from process
					improvement (i.e., automation), operator training, and water conservation to environmental compliance projects.</p>

					<p>Behind every Water Services field representative there exists a team of professionals which includes our
					regional consulting and technical services (CTS) and corporate support staffs. Their job is to provide an
					additional level of field consulting services and act as resources to help fulfill your individual needs.</p>
