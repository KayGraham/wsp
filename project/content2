			<ul>
				<li>Water Services Ltd considers operators training as the most important factor, to the treatment success.</li>
				<li>The best up-to-date training materials, continuously revised, as the conditions are changing,
					supplied at no charge, to the key customers.</li>
			</ul>
				
			<p><strong>Treatment Manuals</strong></p>
			<p>We consider the edition of treatment manuals, as an important tool for the efficient operation of the plant.</p>

			<p>Especially in medium to large plants, where the number of involved people is important, it is 
			often the corresponding operatior replacement. So it is mandatory such a documentation.</p>
			
			<p>The cost of the edition is meaningless, compared to the significancy of the work.</p>
			
			<p>Paper editions of the manuals is common, but we started last year offering the paperless applications
			in electronic forms and computer CDs. We are planning in the near future the Internet (through password protection)
			applications, that will enable continuous updates.</p>
